        <p class="question">Can I cancel anytime?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          Yes!  You can cancel anytime.  If you’re on a yearly plan, we’ll prorate your refund based on the full monthly rate.  Keep in mind, you’ll have 30 days to request an export of your data if you’d like it -- otherwise, we will permanently delete it for your security.

        <p class="question">Is Jazmine secure?</p>
        <p class="answer">Jazmine uses the same 128-bit SSL encryption as most banking systems.  In addition, we encrypt sensitive information at the database level and require a 4-digit pin to access that data.</p>
